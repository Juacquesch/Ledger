Each feature is developed on its own branch named after the convention
"f_featureName". Upon each git commit,
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/Ledger-Software/Ledger) runs checks that
ensure that the codebase successfully builds and that all tests pass.
Once the feature is completely implemented and all Travis checks pass
successfully, a pull request is then opened for the feature. If the
feature is to be merged into master, at least one peer has to complete
a code review and approve the changes. Contact @SeanFromIT with questions.
